# Juvee Game - README

## Introduction

Welcome to the Juvee Game, a fun and engaging side-scrolling runner game inspired by Google's classic 404 Dino game! Instead of a dinosaur, this game features Juvee, an energy drink created by Nadeshot, as the protagonist. This project is a tribute to both the iconic game and the Juvee brand.

The Juvee Game follows a simple yet addictive concept. Players control the Juvee can, making it jump over obstacles and gaps while the screen scrolls automatically. The goal is to survive as long as possible.
